${licensePrefix}This software is a computer program whose purpose is to simulate fish
${licensePrefix}populations and their interactions with their biotic and abiotic environment.
${licensePrefix}OSMOSE is a spatial, multispecies and individual-based model which assumes
${licensePrefix}size-based opportunistic predation based on spatio-temporal co-occurrence
${licensePrefix}and size adequacy between a predator and its prey. It represents fish
${licensePrefix}individuals grouped into schools, which are characterized by their size,
${licensePrefix}weight, age, taxonomy and geographical location, and which undergo major
${licensePrefix}processes of fish life cycle (growth, explicit predation, additional and
${licensePrefix}starvation mortalities, reproduction and migration) and fishing mortalities
${licensePrefix}(Shin and Cury 2001, 2004).
