 * Osmose is a computer program whose purpose is to simulate fish
 * populations and their interactions with their biotic and abiotic environment.
 * OSMOSE is a spatial, multispecies and individual-based model which assumes
 * size-based opportunistic predation based on spatio-temporal co-occurrence
 * and size adequacy between a predator and its prey. It represents fish
 * individuals grouped into schools, which are characterized by their size,
 * weight, age, taxonomy and geographical location, and which undergo major
 * processes of fish life cycle (growth, explicit predation, additional and
 * starvation mortalities, reproduction and migration) and fishing mortalities
 * (Shin and Cury 2001, 2004).

/**
 * This interface gathers the traits that are shared between all marine
 * organisms in Osmose model, either explictly modelled (schools) or in the
 * background (plankton). Schools or swarms of plankton or any other future
 * marine organism included in Osmose must implement the IMarineOrganism
 * interface. Many classes of Osmose do not need to know whether they are
 * dealing with schools, plankton, top predators, etc. and only need access to
 * some characteristics of the organism, such as species index, age, length,
 * trophic level or weight. Generic classes such as AgeStage, LengthStage,
 * PredPreyStage rely on the sole information provided by IMarineOrganism
 * interface and as a consequence will work with any new Object that implements
 * this interface.
