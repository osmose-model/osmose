 *Osmose is a computer program whose purpose is to simulate fish
 *populations and their interactions with their biotic and abiotic environment.
 *OSMOSE is a spatial, multispecies and individual-based model which assumes
 *size-based opportunistic predation based on spatio-temporal co-occurrence
 *and size adequacy between a predator and its prey. It represents fish
 *individuals grouped into schools, which are characterized by their size,
 *weight, age, taxonomy and geographical location, and which undergo major
 *processes of fish life cycle (growth, explicit predation, additional and
 *starvation mortalities, reproduction and migration) and fishing mortalities
 *(Shin and Cury 2001, 2004).
