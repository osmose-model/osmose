 * Osmose is a computer program whose purpose is to simulate fish
 * populations and their interactions with their biotic and abiotic environment.
 * OSMOSE is a spatial, multispecies and individual-based model which assumes
 * size-based opportunistic predation based on spatio-temporal co-occurrence
 * and size adequacy between a predator and its prey. It represents fish
 * individuals grouped into schools, which are characterized by their size,
 * weight, age, taxonomy and geographical location, and which undergo major
 * processes of fish life cycle (growth, explicit predation, additional and
 * starvation mortalities, reproduction and migration) and fishing mortalities
 * (Shin and Cury 2001, 2004).

/**
 * This class represents a school of fish, it is the individual of the
 * Individual Based Model. A school is constituted by a pool of identical fish.
 * This feature allows Osmose to attribute to the school a set of state
 * variables characterising the typical fish of the school:
 * <ul>
 * <li>species<li>
 * <li>age</li>
 * <li>length</li>
 * <li>weight</li>
 * <li>trophic level</li>
 * </ul>
 * The school also has proper state variables:
 * <ul>
 * <li>abundance</li>
 * <li>biomass</li>
 * </ul>
 * Stricto sensus, the fish should be the individual of the IBM but it is
 * unrealistic in terms of computational power to manage such large number of
 * individuals. The concept of school made of fish with identical
 * characteristics offers a good comprise between computational cost and
 * biological relevancy. Later on, when the documentation refers to "fish" it
 * must be understood as the typical fish constituting the school.<br>
 * The {@code School} extends a {@code GridPoint}. It means the school is
 * located with both grid coordinates and geographical coordinates. The way
 * Osmose presently handles spatial movements, it is unnecessarily "fancy" for a
 * school to extends a GridPoint. Indeed Osmose locates the schools in grid
 * cells and does not need more precise coordinates. A mere Cell attribute in
 * the School object would be enough at the moment. The GridPoint opens avenue
 * for future improvement or refinement in the spatial movements of the schools.
