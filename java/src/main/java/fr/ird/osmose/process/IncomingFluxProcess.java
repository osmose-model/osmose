 * Osmose is a computer program whose purpose is to simulate fish
 * populations and their interactions with their biotic and abiotic environment.
 * OSMOSE is a spatial, multispecies and individual-based model which assumes
 * size-based opportunistic predation based on spatio-temporal co-occurrence
 * and size adequacy between a predator and its prey. It represents fish
 * individuals grouped into schools, which are characterized by their size,
 * weight, age, taxonomy and geographical location, and which undergo major
 * processes of fish life cycle (growth, explicit predation, additional and
 * starvation mortalities, reproduction and migration) and fishing mortalities
 * (Shin and Cury 2001, 2004).

/**
 * This class simulates a flux of individuals (biomass) of given age and length
 * in the simulated domain throughout time. Therefore it allows to take into
 * account some species that were not spawned inside the simulated domain and
 * only that enter the domain at a later stage. It acts as a migrating process
 * (for species that do not fulfil a complete life cycle inside the simulated
 * domain but are too significant in terms of biomass or impact upon the other
 * species to be ignored) except that it only controls how a species enters the
 * domain. This is why the class has been called IncomingFluxProcess rather than
 * MigrationProcess, as it does not control when a species leaves temporarily or
 * permanently the domain (refer to MovementProcess for such feature).
 * <br />
 * For each species, the user can provide time series of incoming biomass by
 * time step, structured in age or size class. The incoming flux is provided in
 * a CSV file and is formatted as follow:
 * <br />
 * <table>
 * <tr>
 * <td>time/class</td> <td>class0</td> <td>class1</td> <td>...</td>
 * <td>classn</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>t0</td> <td>biomass_class0_t0</td> <td>biomass_class1_t0</td>
 * <td>...</td> <td>biomass_classn_t0</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>t1</td> <td>biomass_class0_t1</td> <td>biomass_class1_t1</td>
 * <td>...</td> <td>biomass_classn_t1</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>...</td> <td>...</td> <td>...</td> <td>...</td> <td>...</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>tm</td> <td>biomass_class0_tm</td> <td>biomass_class1_tm</td>
 * <td>...</td> <td>biomass_classn_tm</td>
 * </tr>
 * </table>
 * The first row of the file details the age or size structure. Each column of
 * the first row is the lower bound of the age/size class. Age is expressed in
 * year and size in centimetre. There may be as much classes as needed. Osmose
 * will set the age (or size) of the incoming individual as the middle of the
 * age classes. For the last class, Osmose will set the age as the middle of the
 * last age class and the lifespan (or the last size class and the length
 * infinity). For instance if age_class0 is 0, age_class1 is 1 and age_class2 is
 * 2 for a species whose lifespan is 5 years, incoming individuals will be
 * respectively 0.5, 1.5 and 3.5 years old. The biomass are expressed in tonnes.
 * For a given time step and for every age (or size) class with a non-zero
 * incoming biomass, Osmose will distribute the biomass over n new schools, n
 * being the number of schools defined by parameter 'simulation.nschool.sp#'
 * <br />
 * The time series must contain a number of steps that is a multiple of the
 * number of steps per year. If the time series is shorter than the simulation
 * Osmose will loop over it. If the time series is longer than the simulation
 * Osmose will ignore the exceeding years.
 * <br />
 * The class accepts two parameters (one or the other, cannot be both for one
 * species)
 * <ul>
 * <li>flux.incoming.byDt.byAge.file.sp#</li>
 * <li>flux.incoming.byDt.bySize.file.sp#</li>
