Package loading
======================

In order to use the :samp:`osmose` and :samp:`calibrar` R packages on |dat|, the first step is to load the R module as follows:

.. code-block:: csh

    module load R
    module load nco

The following modules will be loaded::

    Currently Loaded Modulefiles:
  1) nco/4.7.1_conda            4) impi/2017.2.174
  2) intel-cc-17/17.0.2.174     5) intel-cmkl-17/17.0.2.174
  3) java/1.8.0                 6) R/3.4.3-intel-17.0.2.174

.. warning:: 

    The :samp:`nco` module must be loaded in order to use the R :samp:`ncdf4` library.


The second step is to define where the libraries are located. In order to avoid multiple copies, a possibility is 
to use the R libraries that have been built in Nicolas Barrier's home. This is done as follows:

.. code-block:: csh

    # CSH users
    setenv R_LIBS_USER /home1/datahome/nbarrier/libs/R/lib

.. code-block:: bash

    # BASH/SH users
    export R_LIBS_USER=/home1/datahome/nbarrier/libs/R/lib

To test whether the libraries are found, run R and types: 

.. code-block:: R

    library("osmose")
    library("calibrar")
