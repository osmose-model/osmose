Running parallel R programs
===============================

Running parallel R programs in |dat| can be achieved in multiple ways (see the examples in */appli/services/exemples/R/*). 

Running on multiple nodes (MPI)
---------------------------------

To run the calibration on multiple nodes, the calibration must be run by using the :samp:`RMPISNOW` program. The calibration is run by using the following PBS file:

.. literalinclude:: _static/datarmor/runCalib_MPI.pbs
    :language: csh

.. hint::
    
    It is possible to use BASH instead of CSH. However, it is highly 
    advised to use CSH, since it is the default |dat| shell.

When using :samp:`RMPISNOW`, the parallel library that must is used is the :samp:`doSNOW` package. As a consequence, the calibration script must be modified as follows:

.. literalinclude:: _static/datarmor/calibrate_MPI.R
    :language: R

The main differences between this R script and the one described in :numref:`para_cuncal` are:

- :samp:`require("doSNOW")` instead of :samp:`require("parallel")`
- No arguments in the :samp:`makeCluster` function
- :samp:`registerDoSNOW` instead of :samp:`registerDoParallel`

Running on a single node
--------------------------------------------

To run the calibration in parallel on a single node (for instance on a Shared Memory machine), the :samp:`doParallel` library is used. In this case, the PBS file is as follows:

.. literalinclude:: _static/datarmor/runCalib_OMP.pbs
    :language: csh

The :samp:`calibrate.R` script must be modified as follows:

.. literalinclude:: _static/datarmor/calibrate_OMP.R
    :language: R

The main difference between this R script and the one described in :numref:`para_cuncal` is:

- :samp:`require("doParallel")` instead of :samp:`require("parallel")`

.. danger::

    The number of cores defined in the :samp:`.pbs` file (:samp:`ncpus`) must be consistent with the value
    in the :samp:`control$nCores` parameter.


Running on a single core (sequential)
--------------------------------------------

To run R in parallel on a single core (i.e. in sequential), the PBS file must be as follows:

.. literalinclude:: _static/datarmor/runCalib_SEQ.pbs
    :language: csh

In this case, no parallel libraries need to be loaded. Hence, the script described in :numref:`caldes` can be used without any modifications.
