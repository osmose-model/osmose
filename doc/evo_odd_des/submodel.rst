Submodels
==========================

The genetic sub-model introduces a source of 
intra-specific variability of quantitative traits in OSMOSE, through additive genetic variance :math:`sigma^2_{A,Z}` and 
expression variance :math:`\sigma^2_{e,Z}` and parental gene inheritance. The individuals are considered diploid 
hermaphrodites, i.e. without differentiation between males and females, the model being based on female life 
history. The genotypic values of the four heritable traits—maximum 
mass-specific ingestion rate :math:`I_{max}`, gonado-somatic index :math:`r` , intercept  and slope  of linear maturation reaction (:math:`m_0` and :math:`m_1`, respectively)
norm—result from the expression of the corresponding functional loci. Neutral loci have no effect on 
individuals’ phenotype: their evolution is the result of random drift. 
Hereafter, the genetic sub-model is described for any of the four evolving traits, generically denoted :math:`Z`.
