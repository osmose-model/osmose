Purpose of the model
=====================

The OSMOSE model represents the dynamics of fish communities. It is a multispecies and spatial model which lies on size-based predation, 
traits-based life history, and individual-based processes. The model aims to explore the functioning of marine ecosystems, the ecosystem effects of 
fishing and climate changes, the impacts of management measures (changes in fishing pressure and fishing strategies, implementation of marine protected areas).
