Resource forcing
=============================

There are two types of input to the model.

First, the spatial dynamics of OSMOSE focus species are driven by spatial distribution maps which can vary according to time (year, season or the age of fish). These maps are derived either from observational data (presence/absence data or density maps) or from climate niche models (see chapter X on integration of climate niches).

Secondly, the modelled system is driven by prey fields which are not explicitly represented as focus species in OSMOSE. For example, biomass fields of phytoplankton and zooplankton varying in space and time are typical input to OSMOSE. In the different OSMOSE applications, these prey fields were usually produced from coupled hydrodynamic and biogeochemical (BGC) models such as ROMS-NPZD (:cite:`Travers2014`), ROMS-PISCES (:cite:`Oliveros2014`), NEMOMed-ECO3M (:cite:`Halouani2016`) or are derived from observational data (:cite:`Gruss2015,Fu2013`). Benthic resources can also drive the dynamics of the system as in Halouani et al. (see chapter X on forcing OSMOSE with hydrodynamic-BGC models).
