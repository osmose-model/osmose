Introduction
----------------------

In order to run the Osmose model, a lot of parameters have to be defined. The parameters are related to the definition 
of the spatial domain (grid definition), to the external forcings (plankton
concentration), and to species.

These files can be difficult to build. As a starting point, the user is invited to visit the `Web Service <www.config.osmose-model.org>`_, which is a 
bridge beetween the `FishBase database <http://www.fishbase.org>`_ and Osmose configuration files.
It allows the user to download configuration files for multiple ecosystems.
