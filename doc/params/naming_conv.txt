Naming convention
---------------------------------------------

Using consistent names throughout the configuration makes the reading and the understanding of the configuration files easy. A good name should instantly give information about the meaning and the function of a parameter. In Osmose we chose to name the parameter following a **descending hierarchical pattern**. The name is divided in several tokens, separated by dots. The left token carries the broader meaning and the following tokens narrow down the definition of the parameter. Let's have a look at a few examples:

.. code-block:: bash
    
    mortality.fishing.rate
    mortality.fishing.recruitment.age
    mortality.starvation.rate
    mortality.starvation.larva.rate

All these parameters deal with the mortality in the model. Some with fishing mortality, some other with starvation mortality. Within the starvation mortality, we need to define the mortality rate for larvae and for the other schools, etc. That is the way most parameter names have been built in Osmose.

When a parameter needs to be defined at species level, it will always show like **.sp0, .sp1, sp2, ..**

.. code-block:: bash
    
    mortality.fishing.rate.sp0
    mortality.fishing.rate.sp1

In the following sections, such parameters will be referred as

.. code-block:: bash
    
    mortality.fishing.rate.sp#

You must remember that, in this case, the :samp:`#` is meant for any integer ranging from zero to maximum number of species minus one.

A parameter name that ends up with **.file** will always designate a file name, and **.path** a path name, either absolute of relative.

.. code-block:: bash
    
    predation.accessibility.file
    output.dir.path

When the parameter is a file that need be defined for every species it will look like **.file.sp#**

.. code-block:: bash
    
    mortality.fishing.season.distrib.file.sp0

Parameters referring to plankton will look like **.plk#**

.. code-block:: bash
    
    plankton.name.plk#

Parameters referring to distribution maps will always look like **.map#**, and parameters referring to 
marine protected areas will always look like **.mpa#**

Keyword **.season** always means that the corresponding parameter deals with seasonal cycles.

The **.enabled** token means that the parameter is a switch that activate or deactivate the process that it designates.
