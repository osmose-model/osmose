movement.randomseed.fixed;True if the random seed should be fixed
movement.distribution.method.sp#;Type of spatial distribution. Either 'random' or 'maps'. If 'random' OSMOSE will look for the parameter 'movement.distribution.ncell.sp#'. If 'maps' OSMOSE will use the maps parameters. See below how to define a map.
movement.distribution.ncell.sp#;Number of adjacent cells where the species is allowed to move around. OSMOSE will select randomly n adjacent cells on the grid at the beginning of the simulation and it will assume it is the area of distribution of this species for the rest of the simulation. Within this randomly created area, the school will move around following a random walk. See the parameter 'movement.randomwalk.range.sp#' for explanation about the random walk process.
movement.randomwalk.range.sp#;Range of the random walk expressed in number of cells. If range = zero, the school remains in the current cell. If range = 1, the school can either stay in the current cell or move in any of the 8 immediately adjacent cells (as long as the destination cell is not land). If range=2, the school can either stay in the current cell or move in any of the 24 immediately adjacent cells (as long as the destination cell is not land). Etc.
