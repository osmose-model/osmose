abstract = {Hypoxia is a decrease in dissolved oxygen that causes physiological disturbances in marine fishes and invertebrates, including reduced mobility, growth rate and reproductive success, altered phenology and increased vulnerability to diseases. Under pressure from global changes such as warming or eutrophication, ocean and coastal ecosystems worldwide are becoming less oxygenated. In order to better understand the consequences of hypoxia on marine systems, there is a need for predicting hypoxia-induced changes from individual organisms to populations. By combining the effect of several stressors on species metabolic performances and life-history traits across their full life-cycle, the Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) theory offers a suitable framework for studying the consequences of hypoxia on marine organisms and to envision an upscaling of these effects at population level through individual-based modelling approaches. Here, we propose a set of stylized biological facts which give a broad generalization of the effects of hypoxia on metabolic functions based on empirical findings. We used these stylized facts to derive assumptions on how to incorporate the effects of hypoxia on marine organisms in the framework of the DEB theory. We then validate some of these assumptions on marine species for which experimental datasets under hypoxic conditions and DEB parameters were available. We discuss the main issues that need to be dealt with, such as the various time-scales, ontogenic responses and multi-stressor effects which appear now as important targets of investigation for studying the effect of hypoxia on marine organisms.}

abstract = {Simulation models that describe autonomous individual organisms (individual based models, IBM) or agents (agent-based models, ABM) have become a widely used tool, not only in ecology, but also in many other disciplines dealing with complex systems made up of autonomous entities. However, there is no standard protocol for describing such simulation models, which can make them difficult to understand and to duplicate. This paper presents a proposed standard protocol, ODD, for describing IBMs and ABMs, developed and tested by 28 modellers who cover a wide range of fields within ecology. This protocol consists of three blocks (Overview, Design concepts, and Details), which are subdivided into seven elements: Purpose, State variables and scales, Process overview and scheduling, Design concepts, Initialization, Input, and Submodels. We explain which aspects of a model should be described in each element, and we present an example to illustrate the protocol in use. In addition, 19 examples are available in an Online Appendix. We consider ODD as a first step for establishing a more detailed common format of the description of IBMs and ABMs. Once initiated, the protocol will hopefully evolve as it becomes used by a sufficiently large proportion of modellers.}

abstract = {The ‘ODD’ (Overview, Design concepts, and Details) protocol was published in 2006 to standardize the published descriptions of individual-based and agent-based models (ABMs). The primary objectives of ODD are to make model descriptions more understandable and complete, thereby making ABMs less subject to criticism for being irreproducible. We have systematically evaluated existing uses of the ODD protocol and identified, as expected, parts of ODD needing improvement and clarification. Accordingly, we revise the definition of ODD to clarify aspects of the original version and thereby facilitate future standardization of ABM descriptions. We discuss frequently raised critiques in ODD but also two emerging, and unanticipated, benefits: ODD improves the rigorous formulation of models and helps make the theoretical foundations of large models more visible. Although the protocol was designed for ABMs, it can help with documenting any large, complex model, alleviating some general objections against such models.}

As a standardized document for providing a consistent, logical and readable account of the structure and dynamics of ABMs, some research groups also find it useful as a workflow for model design. Even so, there are still limitations to ODD that obstruct its more widespread adoption. Such limitations are discussed and addressed in this paper: the limited availability of guidance on how to use ODD; the length of ODD documents; limitations of ODD for highly complex models; lack of sufficient details of many ODDs to enable reimplementation without access to the model code; and the lack of provision for sections in the document structure covering model design rationale, the model&rsquo;s underlying narrative, and the means by which the model&rsquo;s fitness for purpose is evaluated. We document the steps we have taken to provide better guidance on: structuring complex ODDs and an ODD summary for inclusion in a journal article (with full details in supplementary material; Table 1); using ODD to point readers to relevant sections of the model code; update the document structure to include sections on model rationale and evaluation. We also further advocate the need for standard descriptions of simulation experiments and argue that ODD can in principle be used for any type of simulation model. Thereby ODD would provide a lingua franca for simulation modelling.},
