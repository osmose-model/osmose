ODD description
#########################

The present section contains all the necessary information and guidelines to help understand the principles
and assumptions of the OSMOSE model, apply it to a specific case study and run simulations for addressing
specific issues. The OSMOSE model aims at exploring fish community dynamics and the
ecosystem effects of fishing and climate change. It is an Individual-based model (IBM) which
focuses on fish species and their trophic interactions (:cite:`Shin2001,Shin2004`).

The model description in this section follows the ODD ("Overview", "Design concept" and "Details") protocol for describing
individual- or agent-based models (:cite:`GRIMM20102760,GRIMM20102760,grimm2020`).
