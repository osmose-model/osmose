Installation of the calibration library
----------------------------------------

The parameters of the Osmose model must be calibrated for each configuration. This is achieved by using the 
:samp:`calibrar` library. 

The library is stored in GitHub (`https://github.com/roliveros-ramos/calibrar.git <https://github.com/roliveros-ramos/calibrar.git>`_) and can be installed 
following the same methods as described in :numref:`osm_inst`, after changing the URL address.
