Basic principles
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Individuals’ bioenergetics are described according to a biphasic growth model :cite:`andersen2019,  boukal2014life, quince2008biphasic`
in which body mass-dependent energy fluxes are allocated between competing processes —namely maintenance, somatic growth and gonadic growth— thus
accounting for physiological trade-offs that constrain both phenotypically plastic and evolutionary responses of life-history traits
to selective pressures :cite:`roff1992, stearns1992evolution`. Sexual maturation of individuals relies on the concept of maturation reaction norms
that depicts how the process of maturation responds plastically to variation in body growth :cite:`heino2002measuring, stearns1986evolution`.
This combination mechanistically describes the processes of somatic growth, sexual maturation and reproduction as they emerge from energy fluxes
sustained by food intake resulting from size-based opportunistic predation.

On top of the biphasic growth model, individuals’ energy mobilization and maintenance energetic costs depend on dissolved
oxygen concentration and temperature in a way that the resulting
metabolic rate (the net energy available for new tissue production) and thus somatic
and gonadic growth conform to the oxygen- and capacity-limited thermal tolerance theory (OCLTT; :cite:t:`portner2001climate`) and
more generally to thermal performance curves (TPC; :cite:t:`angilletta2009thermal`). In short, oxygen delivery to mitochondria is a
limiting factor of Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis and thus of the mobilization of the energy contained in chemical bonds of
assimilated molecules :cite:`clarke2017principles`. Therefore, dissolved oxygen saturation in water sets up an upper limit to energy mobilization.
Moreover, beyond a temperature range within which energy mobilization increases with temperature due to chemical reaction rate acceleration,
the limitation in ventilation and circulation capacity of individuals as temperature increases is such that oxygen uptake and delivery for
energy mobilization saturates or even decreases at high temperatures, potentially due to temperature dependence of the rate of enzyme-catalyzed
chemical reactions :cite:`arcus2016temperature` or enzyme denaturation :cite:`pawar2015metabolic`. In contrast, maintenance energetic costs increase with
temperature exponentially according to the Arrhenius law :cite:`brown2004toward, gillooly2002effects, kooijman_2009`. It results that when
temperature increases above the individual preferred temperature, energy mobilization increases slower than maintenance costs
resulting mechanistically in a dome-shaped relationship between net energy rate for tissue production (which results from energy
mobilization minus maintenance costs) and temperature that conforms to OCLTT and TPC. These bioenergetic responses to ambient
oxygen and temperature translate into plastic responses of the life-history processes (growth, maturation and reproduction) that
emerge from the energy allocation scheme described by the biphasic growth model but also into selective pressures as individuals
will incur “energetic starvation” mortality when net energy rate is negative and cannot be covered by energy reserves contained in gonads.

Finally, individuals exhibit adaptive behavior in their movements by avoiding foraging
in locations of adverse conditions of dissolved oxygen and temperature :cite:`townhill2017fisheries` that would
impair their net energy rate to the point of certain energetic starvation, thus conforming to the hypothesis of
metabolic constrains on marine habitat and biogeography  :cite:`deutsch2015climate, deutsch2020metabolic`
