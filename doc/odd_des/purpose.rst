Purpose and patterns
===========================

Purpose
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The OSMOSE model represents the dynamics of fish communities. It is a multispecies and spatial model
which lies on size-based predation, traits-based life history, and individual-based processes.
The model aims to explore the functioning of marine ecosystems, the ecosystem effects of
fishing and climate changes, the impacts of management measures (changes in fishing pressure
and fishing strategies, implementation of marine protected areas).

The OSMOSE model represents the ecosystem dynamics of fish communities in
marine ecosystems. It is an individual-based, spatially-explicit multispecies model
accounting for explicit trophic interactions. The main characteristics of the model are
opportunistic predation based on size and spatial co-occurrence of predators and preys

.. and the spatial distribution of individuals is constrained by their physiological niche as
.. they avoid physiologically unfavorable environment.

The aim of the model is to explore the
functioning of marine trophic webs, notably in response
to perturbations such as fishing or climate change.

Patterns
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The model is evaluated by comparing the model outputs with observations
of the marine ecosystem. These observations generally include catches, catches at length, biomass,
abundance for different species.
