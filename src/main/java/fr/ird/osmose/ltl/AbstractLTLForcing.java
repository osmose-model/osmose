 * This software is a computer program whose purpose is to simulate fish
 * populations and their interactions with their biotic and abiotic environment.
 * OSMOSE is a spatial, multispecies and individual-based model which assumes
 * size-based opportunistic predation based on spatio-temporal co-occurrence
 * and size adequacy between a predator and its prey. It represents fish
 * individuals grouped into schools, which are characterized by their size,
 * weight, age, taxonomy and geographical location, and which undergo major
 * processes of fish life cycle (growth, explicit predation, natural and
 * starvation mortalities, reproduction and migration) and fishing mortalities
 * (Shin and Cury 2001, 2004).

/**
 * This class indicates how Osmose manages and retrieves the biomass of the
 * resource compartments of the ecosystem. The resource groups are an input of
 * the model, they are forcing the model biomass as they provide food to the
 * focal species. The class reads the data from a NetCDF file with the following
 * characteristics: (i) the NetCDF grid is the same than the Osmose grid ; (ii)
 * the biomass is provided in variables of the same name than the resource group
 * (time, ny, nx), with time the number of time steps (this value must be a
 * multiple of the number of time step per year in Osmose, and ny, nx the grid
 * dimension. It means the user can provide either one year, 5 years or 50 years
 * of LTL data and Osmose will loop over it until the end of the simulation).
 * The biomass is provided in tonnes.
