 * This software is a computer program whose purpose is to simulate fish
 * populations and their interactions with their biotic and abiotic environment.
 * OSMOSE is a spatial, multispecies and individual-based model which assumes
 * size-based opportunistic predation based on spatio-temporal co-occurrence
 * and size adequacy between a predator and its prey. It represents fish
 * individuals grouped into schools, which are characterized by their size,
 * weight, age, taxonomy and geographical location, and which undergo major
 * processes of fish life cycle (growth, explicit predation, natural and
 * starvation mortalities, reproduction and migration) and fishing mortalities
 * (Shin and Cury 2001, 2004).

/**
 * This interface provides functions to characterise marine aggregations in
 * Osmose, such as schools of fish or swarms of plankton. The interface extends
 * the IMarineOrganism and equips the object with biomass and abundance
 * basically. The idea is to offer common basic features in Osmose to objects
 * that share characteristics though they might play different roles in the
 * model. So far we have explicit schools or plankton swarms, but in future we
 * could easily include background schools (not explicitely modelled) and they
 * would benefit from all the features of the IAggregation, making the
 * integration in the mortality algorithm easier, for instance.
