 * This software is a computer program whose purpose is to simulate trophic
 * interactions between fish species. This model assumes opportunistic
 * predation based on spatial co-occurrence and size adequacy between a
 * predator and its prey (size-based opportunistic predation).
 * It represents fish individuals grouped into schools, which are
 * characterized by their size, weight, age, taxonomy and geographical
 * location (2D model), and which undergo major processes of fish life cycl
 * (growth, explicit predation, natural and starvation mortalities,
 * reproduction and migration) and a fishing mortality distinct for each
 * species (Shin and Cury 2001, 2004).
