 * This software is a computer program whose purpose is to simulate fish
 * populations and their interactions with their biotic and abiotic environment.
 * OSMOSE is a spatial, multispecies and individual-based model which assumes
 * size-based opportunistic predation based on spatio-temporal co-occurrence
 * and size adequacy between a predator and its prey. It represents fish
 * individuals grouped into schools, which are characterized by their size,
 * weight, age, taxonomy and geographical location, and which undergo major
 * processes of fish life cycle (growth, explicit predation, natural and
 * starvation mortalities, reproduction and migration) and fishing mortalities
 * (Shin and Cury 2001, 2004).

/**
 * This class creates an Osmose grid from a BFM NetCDF grid file. The
 * Biogeochemical Flux Model (BFM) is a numerical model for the simulation of
 * the dynamics of major biogeochemical properties in marine ecosystems
 * (http://www.bfm-community.eu).<br>
 * The Osmose grid is aligned on the BFM grid. One Osmose cell is formed by the
 * regular aggregation of BFM cells (squares). The size of the aggregation is
 * given by the stride of the Osmose grid. One Osmose cell is made of
 * {@code stride * stride} BFM cells. An Osmose cell is marked as ocean if more
 * than 50% of the BFM cells in this cell are ocean.<br>
 * This class has been kept for backward compatibility with older configurations
 * of Osmose. Since Osmose version 3, {@link NcGrid} should preferably be used.
