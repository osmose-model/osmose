 * This software is a computer program whose purpose is to simulate fish
 * populations and their interactions with their biotic and abiotic environment.
 * OSMOSE is a spatial, multispecies and individual-based model which assumes
 * size-based opportunistic predation based on spatio-temporal co-occurrence
 * and size adequacy between a predator and its prey. It represents fish
 * individuals grouped into schools, which are characterized by their size,
 * weight, age, taxonomy and geographical location, and which undergo major
 * processes of fish life cycle (growth, explicit predation, natural and
 * starvation mortalities, reproduction and migration) and fishing mortalities
 * (Shin and Cury 2001, 2004).

/**
 * This class creates the Osmose grid from a NetCDF grid file. It is the
 * recommended way to define a grid since Osmose version 3. The function reads
 * longitude, latitude and mask fields from a NetCDF grid file. Osmose assumes
 * that the three fields are two dimensions double arrays. It also expects the
 * latitude and longitude fields to be respectively in degree north and degree
 * east. The mask field must have either zero or negative values for the land.
 * The function does not expect the NetCDF grid file to respect any NetCDF
 * convention (e.g. CF or other OGC convention) for reading it. This should be
 * improved in future release, by the use of GeoToolKit for instance.
