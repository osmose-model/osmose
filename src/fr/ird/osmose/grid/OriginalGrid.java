 * This software is a computer program whose purpose is to simulate fish
 * populations and their interactions with their biotic and abiotic environment.
 * OSMOSE is a spatial, multispecies and individual-based model which assumes
 * size-based opportunistic predation based on spatio-temporal co-occurrence
 * and size adequacy between a predator and its prey. It represents fish
 * individuals grouped into schools, which are characterized by their size,
 * weight, age, taxonomy and geographical location, and which undergo major
 * processes of fish life cycle (growth, explicit predation, natural and
 * starvation mortalities, reproduction and migration) and fishing mortalities
 * (Shin and Cury 2001, 2004).

/**
 * This class is an instance of the original Osmose grid as it has been created
 * by Yunne SHIN in previous version of Osmose. It is a regular orthogonal grid
 * defined by the following parameters:
 * <ul>
 * <li>geographical coordinates of the top left corner of the grid</li>
 * <li>geographical coordinates of the bottom right corner of the grid</li>
 * <li>number of lines</li>
 * <li>number of columns</li>
 * </ul>
 * This class has been kept for backward compatibility with older configurations
 * of Osmose. Since Osmose version 3, {@link NcGrid} should preferably be used.
