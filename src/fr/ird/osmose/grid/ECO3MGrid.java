 * This software is a computer program whose purpose is to simulate fish
 * populations and their interactions with their biotic and abiotic environment.
 * OSMOSE is a spatial, multispecies and individual-based model which assumes
 * size-based opportunistic predation based on spatio-temporal co-occurrence
 * and size adequacy between a predator and its prey. It represents fish
 * individuals grouped into schools, which are characterized by their size,
 * weight, age, taxonomy and geographical location, and which undergo major
 * processes of fish life cycle (growth, explicit predation, natural and
 * starvation mortalities, reproduction and migration) and fishing mortalities
 * (Shin and Cury 2001, 2004).

/**
 * This class creates an Osmose grid from an Eco3M NetCDF grid file. The Eco3M
 * (Ecological Modular Mechanistic Model) numerical platform for biogeochemical
 * modeling developed at LOPB (Baklouti et al., 2006a,b) is a modular tool that
 * handles multi-element multi-functional group biogeochemical models.<br>
 * The Osmose grid is aligned on the Eco3M grid. One Osmose cell is formed by
 * the regular aggregation of Eco3M cells (squares). The size of the aggregation
 * is given by the stride of the Osmose grid. One Osmose cell is made of
 * {@code stride * stride} Eco3M cells. An Osmose cell is marked as ocean if
 * more than 50% of the Eco3M cells in this cell are ocean.<br>
 * This class has been kept for backward compatibility with older configurations
 * of Osmose. Since Osmose version 3, {@link NcGrid} should preferably be used.
