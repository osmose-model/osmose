 * This software is a computer program whose purpose is to simulate fish
 * populations and their interactions with their biotic and abiotic environment.
 * OSMOSE is a spatial, multispecies and individual-based model which assumes
 * size-based opportunistic predation based on spatio-temporal co-occurrence
 * and size adequacy between a predator and its prey. It represents fish
 * individuals grouped into schools, which are characterized by their size,
 * weight, age, taxonomy and geographical location, and which undergo major
 * processes of fish life cycle (growth, explicit predation, natural and
 * starvation mortalities, reproduction and migration) and fishing mortalities
 * (Shin and Cury 2001, 2004).

/**
 * This class loads in memory all LTL data from a NetCDF file at the beginning
 * of the simulation, conversely to other LTL plug-ins that load the data at
 * each time step. It was coded in order to speed up configurations that loop
 * over the same year of LTL data during all the simulation. The class reads the
 * data from a NetCDF file with the following characteristics: (i) the LTL grid
 * is the same than the Osmose grid ; (ii) the biomass is provided in a variable
 * called ltl_biomass(time, ltl, ny, nx), with time the number of time steps
 * (this value must be a multiple of the number of time step per year in Osmose.
 * It means the user can provide either one year, 5 years or 50 years of LTL
 * data and Osmose will loop over it until the end of the simulation), ltl the
 * number of plankton groups ordered the same way as in the configuration (e.g.
 * plankton.name.plk0, plankton.name.plk1, etc.), ny the number of lines, nx the
 * number of columns. The biomass is provided in tonnes. The NetCDF file is
 * designated by parameter 'ltl.netcdf.file'.
