 * This software is a computer program whose purpose is to simulate fish
 * populations and their interactions with their biotic and abiotic environment.
 * OSMOSE is a spatial, multispecies and individual-based model which assumes
 * size-based opportunistic predation based on spatio-temporal co-occurrence
 * and size adequacy between a predator and its prey. It represents fish
 * individuals grouped into schools, which are characterized by their size,
 * weight, age, taxonomy and geographical location, and which undergo major
 * processes of fish life cycle (growth, explicit predation, natural and
 * starvation mortalities, reproduction and migration) and fishing mortalities
 * (Shin and Cury 2001, 2004).

/**
 * This class controls the reproduction process in the simulated domain. The
 * user defines the spawning season (a CSV file per Species) either annual or
 * interannual, the percentage of female in the population (sex ratio) and the
 * number of eggs per gramme of mature female (alpha) for every species. Osmose
 * estimates the spawning stock biomass (SSB) and calculates the number of eggs
 * to be released in the system at every time steps.<br />
 * During the spin-up of the simulation (duration of spin-up either set by the
 * user or set by default to the lifespan of the longest-lived species) Osmose
 * prevents species collapse by artificially setting the SSB to a predefined
 * level (user defined, this parameter could/should be calibrated) in order to
 * guarantee egg release.
