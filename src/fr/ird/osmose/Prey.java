 * This software is a computer program whose purpose is to simulate fish
 * populations and their interactions with their biotic and abiotic environment.
 * OSMOSE is a spatial, multispecies and individual-based model which assumes
 * size-based opportunistic predation based on spatio-temporal co-occurrence
 * and size adequacy between a predator and its prey. It represents fish
 * individuals grouped into schools, which are characterized by their size,
 * weight, age, taxonomy and geographical location, and which undergo major
 * processes of fish life cycle (growth, explicit predation, natural and
 * starvation mortalities, reproduction and migration) and fishing mortalities
 * (Shin and Cury 2001, 2004).

/**
 * This class provides a record of predation events on marine organisms (refer
 * to IMarineOrganism interface) that share the same species index, trophic
 * level, age and length. A record keep tracks of the species index of the prey,
 * the preyed biomass, the age, the length and the trophic level of the prey. It
 * implements the IMarineOrganism interface so the Prey can be handled by the
 * Stages classes (AgeStage, LengthStage, etc.) in the outputs for instance. The
 * Prey class does not represent a specific school or plankton swarm. It must be
 * seen as a record of preyed biomass by a predator, from potentially distinct
 * schools that share the same species, age, length and trophic level. That is
 * why the biomass variable is not final: predation events from a predator on
 * different schools with same species, age, length and trophic level will just
 * increase the preyed biomass of a single Prey. The class has been designed in
 * such a way to avoid the creation of hundred of thousands of Prey objects (as
 * I did initially, i.e. one predation event, one prey record which lead to heap
 * memory problem).
