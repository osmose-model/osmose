Description: The multispecies and individual-based model (IBM) 'OSMOSE'
  (Shin and Curry (2001) <doi:10.1016/S0990-7440(01)01106-8> and Shin and Curry 
  (2004) <doi:10.1139/f03-154>) focuses on fish species. This model assumes 
  opportunistic predation based on spatial co-occurrence and size adequacy 
  between a predator and its prey (size-based opportunistic predation). It
  represents fish individuals grouped into schools, which are characterized by 
  their size, weight, age, taxonomy and geographical location (2D model), and 
  which undergo major processes of fish life cycle (growth, explicit predation, 
  natural and starvation mortalities, reproduction and migration) and fishing 
  exploitation. The model needs basic biological parameters that are often 
  available for a wide range of species, and which can be found in 'FishBase' 
  for instance (see <http://www.fishbase.org/search.php>), and fish spatial 
  distribution data. This package provides tools to build and run simulations 
  using the 'OSMOSE' model.
