This software is a computer program whose purpose is to simulate fish
populations and their interactions with their biotic and abiotic environment.
OSMOSE is a spatial, multispecies and individual-based model which assumes
size-based opportunistic predation based on spatio-temporal co-occurrence
and size adequacy between a predator and its prey. It represents fish
individuals grouped into schools, which are characterized by their size,
weight, age, taxonomy and geographical location, and which undergo major
processes of fish life cycle (growth, explicit predation, additional and
starvation mortalities, reproduction and migration) and fishing mortalities
(Shin and Cury 2001, 2004).
