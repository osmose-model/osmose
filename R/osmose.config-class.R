# Osmose is a computer program whose purpose is to simulate fish
# populations and their interactions with their biotic and abiotic environment.
# OSMOSE is a spatial, multispecies and individual-based model which assumes
# size-based opportunistic predation based on spatio-temporal co-occurrence
# and size adequacy between a predator and its prey. It represents fish
# individuals grouped into schools, which are characterized by their size,
# weight, age, taxonomy and geographical location, and which undergo major
# processes of fish life cycle (growth, explicit predation, additional and
# starvation mortalities, reproduction and migration) and fishing mortalities
# (Shin and Cury 2001, 2004).

#' @title Plot method for \code{osmose.config} objects
#' @description This method takes a \code{osmose.config} object and produce

#' function for more details.
#' @param what Variable name to plot. By default is \code{what = "predation"}. 
#' See Details.
#' @param ... Additional arguments for the plot function.

#'  for more information about this object.
#' @param what Name of the variable to extract from the configuration file.
